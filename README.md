# Grading System
This project focuses on developing a Grading System that utilizes PHP for backend processing and XML for data storage. The system is designed to help educational institutions efficiently manage, store, and retrieve student grades and performance data. By using XML as a lightweight database format, this system offers a flexible and straightforward solution for handling data, while PHP provides the necessary server-side scripting for dynamic interactions and processing.

## Project Features
- Student Data Entry: The system allows administrators or teachers to enter students’ information, including names, student IDs, subjects, and grades, directly through a user-friendly interface. This information is then stored in XML format for easy access and scalability.
- Grade Calculation: PHP scripts calculate final grades based on a predefined grading scale, taking input from various assessments (e.g., assignments, tests, and exams) and automatically computing cumulative scores.
- Data Retrieval and Display: The system retrieves and displays data dynamically. Teachers and administrators can view student grades, and students can log in to check their own scores. XML’s structured format makes it easy to organize and access specific data fields.
